### Main properties file - src/main/resources/application.properties is picked as test properties file because src/test/resources/application.properties does not exist
### This file overrides the main properties file for testing purposes.
### Overriding without specifing some profile in test command is possible due to the fact that `default` is default spring profile - hence this file is named `application-default.properties`
